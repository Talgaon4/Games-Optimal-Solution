A round of the game consists of each player taking one turn to try to shut the box.
A turn consists of a player repeatedly throwing the dice until he or she cannot continue.
Each throw of the dice is taken as follows:
If 7, 8 and 9 are all covered, the player decides whether to throw one die or two.
If any of these 3 numbers are still uncovered, the player must use both dice.
The player throws the die or dice into the box and adds up the pips.
 The player must then cover available numbers that add up to the total thrown.
 So for instance, if the total is 8, the player may choose one of the following options:
8, 7&1, 6&2, 5&3, 5&2&1, 4&3&1
