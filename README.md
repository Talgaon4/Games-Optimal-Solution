# World Of Games
If you have too much free time and you like to exercise your brain then World Of Games is the solution for you.
In the application you can play thinking and logic games implemented in Python and Tkinter.
Although Tkinter is not the best GUI, its use is challenging and provides a good enough result.
And the most important thing is that in most games you can use AI to help you make the best move at every stage of the game.
