Shut The Box is a game in which the player starts with 9 open cards with values 1-9. On each turn, 2 dice are thrown and cards with a total value equal to the throw are taken down. The goal of the game is to take down all the cards.

In this version of the game, an AI can be used to choose the best move. This move will leave the maximum number of options for possible throws in the next turn.

Note that when the cards 7, 8, or 9 are taken down, the player can decide whether to roll one or two dice.

In Numberle, the player must guess a 4-digit random number composed of the digits 1-5 without any repetitions, all within 6 tries.

For an extra challenge, the player can choose to use an AI assistant that will guess the best available answer on each turn.

After each guess, the player will receive feedback in the form of green and yellow colors. Green indicates the number of digits that are in the correct position of the guessed number, while yellow indicates the number of digits that appear in the number but in a different position.

Can you crack the code in just 6 tries?
