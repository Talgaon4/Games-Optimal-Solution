# World Of Games
If you have too much free time and you like to exercise your brain then World Of Games is the solution for you.
In the application you can play thinking and logic games implemented in Python and Tkinter.
Although Tkinter is not the best GUI, its use is challenging and provides a good enough result.
And the most important thing is that in most games you can use AI to help you make the best move at every stage of the game.

To run the application you have to download the files and run the Intro file, all libraries are pre-built in Python

The game starts with 9 open cards with the values 1-9.
In each turn, 2 game dice are thrown, and then cards are taken down whose total value is the value of the throw so that the goal of the game is to take down all the cards.
AI can be used to choose the best move so that choosing this move leaves the maximum number of options for possible throws in the next turn.
*When the cards 7,8,9 are taken down then the user can decide whether to roll one or two dice
